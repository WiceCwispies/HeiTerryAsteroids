# Fuzzy Asteroids

This repository is a dependency for the [2021 UC Fuzzy Challenge repository](https://github.com/TimArnettThales/UCFuzzyChallenge). 
in which it is used as the simulation environment for the development of Fuzzy Logic AIs by competitors.

## Dependencies

The Python Arcade Library is the primary dependency for this repo and is used for creating the environment
for the game. 

To run the ga you simply run the AsteriodFGA.py file
To run the example solution run the sample_training_script.py
We are expecting much more progress in the future in optimizing and training our fuzzy system
